This is a tabletop manipulation scene with a Franka robotic arm. 
The task is: {{ task_description }}.

You are given {{ image_paths|length }} different views of the same scene:
{% for _ in image_paths -%}
<image>{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

Before reaching the current frame, the following sub-tasks have been performed or are in progress:
{{ pre_sub_tasks | join(', ') if pre_sub_tasks else 'No history' }}

Based on the task, the current scene, and the sub-tasks that have been performed or are in progress, determine what the robot should do next (the next sub-task). 

Output in the following XML format:
<reasoning>natural language description of reasoning</reasoning>
<sub_task>natural language description of the next sub-task</sub_task>
